BomberKillers is a remake game of Bomberman, which is very famous back to early 2000s in Asia. Here what we want to do is to make the games in higher resolution, also support 4 players play it together (offline and local hosts server ”LAN”), which we cannot do back in the days. We will make the game use python also with the pygame library in VS code.
