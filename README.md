# BomberKillers
This is a teamwork project for Tools of software projects. We are a team with 4 ELTE computer science BSc students.

Project management is done in the Github/Issues, we divide tasks and showing the current process there. For each milestone, the task and process is clear to every teammember.
We put forward questions and communicate about issues with other. Meanwhile, we also welcome any questions or suggestions from the outsider to help us grow.

BomberKillers is a remake game of Bomberman, which is very famous back to early 2000s in Asia. Here what we want to do is to make the games in higher resolution, also support 4 players play it together (offline and local hosts server ”LAN”), which we cannot do back in the days. We will make the game use python also with the pygame library in VS code.

When starting the game, the first view is in the login interface, you need to wait for several seconds and then choose single or multli play!
As long as all the monsters did in single play or only one player left, the winner will be announced and the game finished.
